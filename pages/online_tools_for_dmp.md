## Ways to write a DMP
In order to write your DMP, you can:
* Download the funders’ template and fill it in.
* Use one of the numerous web-based tools available.

## How to choose the tool for writing a DMP
1. Check what your institute or university advises to use.
2. Check what your funder suggests.
3. Choose one of the tools suggested below.
